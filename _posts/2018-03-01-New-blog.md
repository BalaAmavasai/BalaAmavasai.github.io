Welcome to my blog! I've always meant to consolidate my writings, both technical and non-technical into one site, and here's my attempt at doing it in 2018.

So what would I like to write about? I've frequently been told that I'm very opinionated when it comes to technology. In addition I'm supposedly a recognised (and hopefully not self-declared!) expert in the areas of machine learning, computer vision and several other fields. So it's a 2-in-1. You will receive opinions, commentary and advise with regards to these areas. In return, I ask for debate and a healthy exchange of opinions. I will start by committing myself to one post a month, and see how we get on.

I'm going to trial the amazing [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) tool for this blog, so let's see how I get on. 

The postings on this blog do not reflect the opinions of my current or previous employers.
